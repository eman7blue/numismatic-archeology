Numismatic Archeology is a collect-a-thon mod that adds eight collectable coins that can be found throughout the world. You can also find some more suspicious blocks generated in the world!

## The Coins

There are eight coins which can be found in-game:
* Animal Coin: Dug up in badlands buried hoards
* Bee Coin: Dug up in desert buried hoards
* Ender Coin: Found in end cities
* Parrot Coin: Found in jungle temples
* Piglin Coin: Dug up in housing bastions
* Sniffer Coin: Dug up desert wells
* Turtle Coin: Dug up in desert pyramids
* Villager Coin: Traded for with Wandering Trader

Collect all eight coins to craft a trophy!

The coins have to be in alphabetical order, otherwise it won't work.

## Buried Hoard

The buried hoard feature spawns in deserts and badlands. It's disguised as a normal dead bush, however with suspicious sand (or red sand) underneath it, which might contain a coin. Buried near is a hidden barrel with treasure inside!

## New Bastion Content

The Hoglin Stable and Housing Bastions now generate with suspicious soul sand, which generates different loot depending on where it is spawned.

The piglin coin can only be found in the center of housing bastions.

***
Still a WIP, the plan is to make every coin only available through the archeology mechanic. Nearly all content is locked behind the 1.20 experimental datapack, which is highly recommended to be on for a proper experience.

Thanks to SquidCat for the suspicious block textures <3.
