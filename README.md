Numismatic Archeology is a mod that adds eight collectable coins that can be found throughout the world, including one in a new generated desert feature, called a buried hoard.

## Coins

There are eight coins which can be found in game:
* Animal Coin: Found in shipwrecks
* Bee Coin: Dug up in buried hoards
* Ender Coin: Found in end cities
* Parrot Coin: Found in jungle temples
* Piglin Coin: Found in bastions
* Sniffer Coin: Dug up desert wells
* Turtle Coin: Dug up in desert pyramids
* Villager Coin: Traded for with Wandering Trader

Collect all eight coins to craft a trophy!

## Buried Hoard

The buried hoard feature spawns in deserts. It's disguised as a normal dead bush, however with suspicious sand underneath it, which might contain a bee coin. Buried near is a hidden barrel with treasure inside!

***

Still a WIP, the plan is to make every coin only available through the archeology mechanic. Nearly all content is locked behind the 1.20 feature flag, except for buried hoards, which still generate without the suspicious sand.
