Numismatic Archeology is an exploration mod that adds eight collectable coins that can be found throughout the world using the new archeology mechanics in the Trails & Tales update! You can also find some more structures generated in the world!

## The Coins

There are eight coins which can be found in-game:
* Animal Coin: Dug up in badlands buried hoards
* Bee Coin: Dug up in desert buried hoards
* Ender Coin: Dug up in end temples
* Parrot Coin: Dug up in bamboo shrines
* Piglin Coin: Dug up in housing bastions
* Sniffer Coin: Dug up in warm ocean ruins
* Turtle Coin: Dug up in desert pyramids
* Villager Coin: Dug up in villages

Collect all eight coins to craft a trophy!

The coins have to be in alphabetical order, otherwise it won't work.

## New Archeology Tools

### Diamond Brush

The diamond brush is a better version of the brush, and brushes up items at twice the speed.

### Magnifying Glass

The magnifying glass can be used to see what is inside a suspicious block before it is brushed.

### Numismatic Desk

The numismatic desk can be used to discover the conditions of coins. The common conditions are Poor and Fine, with the Superb condition being the rarest. The desk can also be used to store coins if needed, and functions as the workstation for the archeologist villager.

## Buried Hoard

The buried hoard feature spawns in deserts and badlands. It's disguised as a normal dead bush, however with suspicious sand (or red sand) underneath it, which might contain a coin. Buried near is a hidden barrel with treasure inside!

## New Structures

### Bamboo Shrine

The bamboo shrine spawns in bamboo forests and is where you can find the parrot coin! Keep digging once you find it, because there might be more to to this shrine than meets the eye...

### End Temple

This simple structure generates in the End, and is where the end coin is found.

### Village Additions

The archeologist is a new addition to villages! You can trade sherds with them, or go see what is hiding in the dig site nearby (the dig site does not generate in snowy and taiga villages, but they have a loot chest to compensate).

### Bastion Additions

The Hoglin Stable and Housing Bastions now generate with suspicious soul sand, which generates different loot depending on where it is spawned.

The piglin coin can only be found in the center of housing bastions.

## Some "shocking" new additions

### Thunderstone

Thunderstone blocks generate when regular stone is struck by lightning. Mine it to get Thunderstone, which is used in crafting recipes regarding new lightning mechanics.

### Ancient Activation

The Ancient Activator is crafted using thunderstone, and is used in ancient activation crafting. Striking thunderstone with lightning on the ancient activator charges it, and it can be used to summon lighting when used once. Perhaps some other odd things can be ancient activated.

## What's Next?

* More interesting archeology finds
* More odd figurines
* Brush enchantments
* Something in the badlands...

### Note for 1.19.4

I don't plan on supporting 1.19.4 and any previous versions due to much of the content is locked behind the 1.20 experimental datapack and the archeology mechanic. That version only exists because it was the most recent release which includes archeology. This mod is mainly focused on the Trails & Tales update.

Thanks to SquidCat for the suspicious block textures <3.
